puts 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6 #calculates math parentheses unnecessary

puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?" #with qoutations just repeats what is written within
#
puts 3 + 2 < 5 - 7 #without qoutations does math concludes it is false

puts "What is 3 + 2? #{3 + 2}" #qoutations just repeats what is written
puts "What is 5 - 7? #{5 - 7}" #quotations therefore No math

puts "Oh, that's why it's false."
